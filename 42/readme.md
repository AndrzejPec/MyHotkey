[h1]My Tobacco - Hotkey Mod[/h1]

With this mod you can assign hotkey to [b][i]SMOKING[/i][/b] and [b][i]CHEWING[/i][/b] tobacco (and other smokeable or other tobacco products) - moreover you get to choose which of the product to use (i.e. a cigarette or a cigar) by conveniently showing you a dialog menu (modal or radial - you can set a different hotkey to either of these options).

This mod is [b][u]ONLY[/u][/b] compatible with build 42!
It is - [b]in theory[/b] - completely safe to add or remove from an existing save.

[h2]Setup[/h2]

Options -> Key Bindings -> Tobacco mod
... & Enjoy!

Don't forget to leave your feedback in the comments! Do you like the modal or radial option more? This can help me decide in which direction to develop the mod :)

- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951287846]Clove cigarettes[/url]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2734185609&searchtext=skal]SKAL smokeless tobacco[/url] (the American equivalent of European snus I believe)

- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3409836763]SupportCorps[/url]

You can also assign a separate hotkey to chew tobacco/hemp (SKAL mod and hemp mod add alternatives to chewing tobacco)

[b]The game lets you choose which item to use[/b] via a [b]dialogue box (modal window)[/b] or a [b]radial menu[/b] (like the one for vehicles and animals) unless there's only one type available, in which case it will be used automatically.

[u]You must have a lighter[/u] in your inventory or backpack to smoke, obviously. Disposable lighter, BBQ lighter, matches, or a lit candle will do the job aswell.

[h2]Changenotes:[/h2]

Ver 1.3 (6 II 2025):
- introduced radial functionality, you can now hotkey a radial-smoking menu (experimental)
- added a lot of new items from mod NnC Narcotics and items from two new mods - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3409836763]SupportCorps[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3421508458]ReeferMadness[/url]


Ver 1.2 (3 II 2025):
- added missing functionality for cluvius smoking brand
- added missing smoking pipe weed functionality for the NnC mod
- added missing BBQlighter functionality
- fixed not being able to smoke/chew while walking
- added a padding for the last "close" button in order for it to stand out from the choice selection
- fixed wrong/missing indication/information for when the player has cigarettes but not unpacked (he had said that he did not have any earlier leading to confusion) or even no dialogue box at all (so user could assume the mod is not functioning at all)
- added missing polish translation lines
- commented out the debug console prints (de-littering)
- overall efficiency tweaks
- consistency amendments in descriptions/modinfo/github

Ver 1.1 (2 II 2025):

- added all the smokeable items from mods:
   + [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3404956403&searchtext=narcotics]N&C's Narcotics[/url]
