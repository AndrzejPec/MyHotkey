[h1]My Tobacco - Hotkey Mod[/h1]

[i]Please read the description carefully; important info is marked in [b]bold[/b]. Mind this is still a WIP - active development.[/i]

This mod enhances the use of tobacco products (mainly cigarettes and chewing tobacco). It works seamlessly with three additional mods introducing new smokeables and tobacco (details below). The key feature is that it allows players to [b]assign a hotkey[/b] for using these products.

[h2]Hotkey Setup[/h2]

The hotkeys are left [b]unassigned by default[/b] to prevent conflicts with your current keybindings.  
You can assign them in the game's [b]keybinding section[/b] (found in [b]Game Options > Key bindings[/b] â€” not in the mod settings).

[h2]Usage Instructions[/h2]

[b][UNASSIGNED]:[/b] Smoke a (rolled) cigarette/cigar/cheroot. If you have compatible mods, this will also enable smoking:
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3388593176]Cluvius brand crack cigarettes[/url]  
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951287846]Clove cigarettes[/url]  

[b][UNASSIGNED]:[/b] Use snus or chewing tobacco. This includes:
- Base game chewing tobacco (B42)  
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2734185609&searchtext=skal]SKAL creations[/url] (the American equivalent of European snus I believe)  

The game lets you choose which item to use via a [b]dialogue box (modal window)[/b] unless there's only one type available, in which case it will be used automatically.  
You must have a [b]lighter, disposable lighter, BBQ lighter, matches, or a lit candle[/b] to use the smoking functionality.

[h2]Compatibility and Known Issues[/h2]

- [b]Current Mod Conflicts:[/b]  
  The only known conflict is with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3134858822&searchtext=cutlery]Rick's Cutlery mod[/url], where the lighter functionality is affected, leading to animation bugs.

- [b]Inventory Requirements:[/b]  
  Snus must be in your [b]main inventory[/b] to be used. Items in containers will be listed but not usable.

- [b]Future Plans:[/b]  
  Upcoming updates will include compatibility with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3404563567&searchtext=hemp]Hemp & Tobacco mod[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3404956403]N&C's Narcotics[/url] and functionality to unpack cigarettes from sealed packs.
