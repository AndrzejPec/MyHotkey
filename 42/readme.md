**My Tobacco - Hoykey Mod**

*Please read the description carefully; important info is marked in bold. Mind this is still a WIP - active development*

This mod enhances the use of tobacco products (mainly cigarettes and chewing tobacco). It works seamlessly with three additional mods introducing new smokeables and tobacco (details below). The key feature is that it allows players to assign a hotkey for using these products.

**Hotkey Setup:**

The hotkeys are left unassigned by default to prevent conflicts with your current keybindings. You can assign them in the game's keybinding section (found in "Game Options > Controls" â€” not in the mod settings).

**Usage Instructions:**
[UNASSIGNED]: Smoke a (rolled) cigarette/cigar/cheroot. If you have compatible mods, this will also enable smoking:
- Cluvius brand crack cigarettes
- Clove cigarettes
[UNASSIGNED]: Use snus or chewing tobacco. This includes:
- Base game chewing tobacco (B42)
- SKAL creations (the American equivalent of European snus)

The game lets you choose which item to use via a dialogue box (modal window) unless there's only one type available, in which case it will be used automatically. You must have a lighter, disposable lighter, BBQ lighter, matches, or a lit candle to use the smoking functionality.

**Compatibility and Known Issues:**

Current Mod Conflicts: The only known conflict is with [Rick's Cutlery mod], where the lighter functionality is affected, leading to animation bugs.
Inventory Requirements: Snus must be in your main inventory to be used. Items in containers will be listed but not usable.
Future Plans: Upcoming updates will include compatibility with the Hemp & Tobacco mod and functionality to unpack cigarettes from sealed packs.
Feedback and Support: This is my first mod, so your feedback is highly appreciated! If you encounter any issues, please report them in the discussion thread. I'm actively working on updates and bug fixes, so your input is invaluable!

**Language & translations**

The mod comes out of the box with English and Polish localization, feel free to provide translations in your language, I'll add them in.
