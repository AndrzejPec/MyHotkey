TOBACCO MOD

<<Please read the description, I'll mark the important info bold>>

This mod facilitates the use of tobacco-based products (mainly cigarettes and chewing tobacco, however it does work with three mods introducing new smokeables and tobacco - details below).
It does so by letting the user assign a hotkey to the action of using tobacco proudct.

I decided to leave the hotkeys unassigned in order to not cause any conflicts with your present key bindings. The hotkeys can be set in the keybinding section of the game's options (NOT the mod options)

Press [UNASSIGNED] to smoke a (rolled) cigarette/cigar/cheroot. If you have the corresponding mod, it will also let you smoke:
- [url= ]Cluvius brand crack cigarettes[/url]
- [url= ]Clove cigarettes[/url]

Press [UNASSIGNED] to put a snus in your lip - by snus I mean either chewing tobacco (which is in the base game for B42) or [url= ]SKAL creations[/url] (which I guess is the american version of what we call snus in Europe)

The game does not decide what product to use, instead it lets you decide for yourself by showing a dialogue box (modal window) where you can select the exact kind of item to be used (see screenshots).
If there is however only one kind of cigarette or snus in your inventory, you'll not be prompted, but use that one available item.
You need to posses one of the following items in order to be able to use the smoking funcitonality: lighter, dosposable lighter, BBQ lighter, matches, or a lit candle.

I have found only one mod that has conflict with this, although I'm pretty sure that the fault is not on my part, since my mod does not alter any of the vanilla records.
Mind however that this is my first mod (and I run only a limited number of mods myself), and I have not consulted anyone in the process of creating it. It's also still a WIP, so if you run into any problems/errors, please let me know in the discussion thread.

Known issues / TO-DO list:
- The mod has been tested hard by myself during hours of gameplay. The only conflict I have found is with [url= ]Rick's Cutlery[/url] mod. It's still possible to use both mods, but the game seems not to be able to use the lighter (and you smoke without using the lighter, lo and behold, the animation is bugged too).
- You need to be having the snus in your main inventory (not inside any container) to be able to use it. If the snus is in a container, the game WILL list it in the modal window, but WILL NOT let you use it when you select it. For now you need to have that in mind and keep snus in you main inv.
- I'm planning to incorporate functionality for the mod Hemp & tobacco - I've been so busy with this mod for the past 3 weeks that I didn't get to test hemp mod yet.
- Next, I'll want to add funcitonality to let the player unpack cigarettes from a sealed pack of cigarettes, and/or have the game take one cigarette out of the pack in order to smoke it.

I hope you enjoy the mod and please be understanding if you run into any errors, I'm gonna be greateful for your feedback and I'll make sure to these errors ASAP.
